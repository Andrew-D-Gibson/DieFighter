## 2026-09-17 — Multi-sector runs, jump gates, and a real victory condition

**Built:** The whole DEMO_PLAN progression spine. A run is now three sectors
long instead of one open-ended sector that never ended.

- `GameSaveResource.sector_index` tracks how deep the run is, and persists
  through `SaveManager` (additive JSON key, old saves read it as 0 — no
  version bump needed).
- `_randomize_sector_scenarios()` now appends the previously-orphaned
  `jump_gate.tres` *after* the boss, so the gate — not the boss — is the last
  tile of every sector. That scenario already existed, flagged
  `sector_gate_scenario = true`, and was never referenced by anything.
- New `GameStateManager._check_sector_cleared()` fires on `combat_finished`;
  if the cleared tile was the last one and it's a sector gate, it hands off to
  `_advance_to_next_sector()`, which either generates a fresh, harder sector
  and replays the normal hyperspace jump into it, or ends the run.
- `Map.load_sector()` extracted out of `_load_game_save()` so the map can be
  repointed at a brand-new scenario list mid-run without faking a save load
  (which would have clobbered player/tile state).
- `JumpManager._jump_to_scenario` → public `jump_to_scenario`, and
  `Globals.jump_manager` added, so sector transitions reuse the exact same
  jump animation the player already knows.
- Difficulty is one number: `get_difficulty_multiplier()` = `1 + sector *
  0.35`, applied at `Enemy._update_health_from_resource()` — the single choke
  point every spawned enemy passes through. Verified live: an 18 HP Venom
  Fighter spawns at 25 HP in sector 2.
- `Events.victory` + `GameState.VICTORY`. `game_over.gd` used to show
  "VICTORY!" on *every* `BOSS_DEFEATED`, which would now fire once per sector;
  it listens to `Events.victory` instead. `SaveManager` deletes the save on
  victory the same way it does on game over.

**Why:** The game had a combat layer and no run. Nothing escalated, nothing
ended. This is the smallest change that makes a session have a shape.

**Verified:** Ran the project, drove `_check_sector_cleared()` from a live
eval at the gate index — sector 2 generated with a fresh gate at its end, the
jump animation played, enemy HP scaled 1.35x, and forcing the third clear
produced state `VICTORY`, a deleted save, and the victory screen.

**Known noise (pre-existing, not mine):** boot spews ~184 errors from the four
`ComplicatedTileResources/*.tres` still referencing the deleted pre-V2 effect
system. `RewardManager._load_tile_resources()` tries to load them every run.
Worth porting to EffectChainV2 — they have good ideas in them.
